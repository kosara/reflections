What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you run "git init", a folder called .git is created that will contain the history of the files.
	To delete a repository (but keep the files) delete the .git folder.
	We need it to be able to use version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	Working directory is the local version you work on.
	Staging area is where you add changes to make sure you know what to commit,
	especially if it's spread in many different files.
	Repository is the thing + the changes history.
	You can chose what makes sense to commit as a logical change.
